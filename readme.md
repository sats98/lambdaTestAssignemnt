###Problem statement

A SQL table containing columns testCaseId , startDate, endDate and status of a Table Testcases is given.
A lot of data is streaming in continously. You need to find the maximum concurrency occured in a given period of time (lets say last hour).


I am trying to make a result using all the distinct timestamps in the table. (UNION strips duplicates.)

 SELECT startDate as time FROM Testcases
 UNION 
 SELECT endDate as time FROM Testcases

 After getting the result i can see how many testcases are active/running at these points in time. So I am grouping by 

SELECT COUNT(*) as concurrent, time.time
FROM Testcases 
JOIN (
    SELECT startDate as time FROM Testcases
    UNION 
    SELECT endDate as time FROM Testcases
) time ON Testcases.startDate <= time.time AND Testcases.endDate > time.time
GROUP BY time.time

We can compund index on (startDate,endDate) 
Now we can group the result set by the specified time here (hourly) to get the maximum cuncurrency for the last hour.

```SELECT DATE_FORMAT(time, '%Y-%m-%d %H:00') hour_beginning,
       MAX(concurrent) concurrent
    FROM (
         SELECT COUNT(*) as concurrent, time.time
            FROM Testcases 
            JOIN (
                SELECT startDate as time FROM Testcases
                UNION 
                SELECT endDate as time FROM Testcases
                ) time ON Testcases.startDate <= time.time AND Testcases.endDate > time.time
                GROUP BY time.time
        ) q
        GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(time, '%Y-%m-%d %H:00') ```

This is the final query


// example input

CREATE TABLE Testcases (
  `id` INTEGER,
  `startDate` DATETIME,
  `endDate` DATETIME
  `status` Boolean
);

INSERT INTO Testcases
  (`id`, `startDate`, `endDate`)
VALUES
  ('1', '2011-12-19 06:00:00', '2011-12-19 08:45:00',true),
  ('2', '2011-12-19 06:15:00', '2011-12-19 06:30:00',true),
  ('3', '2011-12-19 06:30:00', '2011-12-19 06:45:00'true),
  ('4', '2011-12-19 06:40:00', '2011-12-19 07:15:00'true),
  ('5', '2011-12-19 07:15:00', '2011-12-19 08:45:00'true),
  ('6', '2011-12-19 07:30:00', '2011-12-19 07:50:00'true),
  ('7', '2011-12-19 08:00:00', '2011-12-19 08:30:00'true),
